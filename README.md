# TW Reporter
New Media foundation in Taiwan.

# Environment
  Install node(https://nodejs.org/en/) v4.x.x or v6.x.x first.

# Installation
    $ npm install

# Pre-process
    $ cp api/config.example.js api/config.js 
edit api/config.js to connect to your own api host <br />
if you have no api server, you can follow [this](https://github.com/twreporter/twreporter-react/blob/revamp/README.md#build-your-own-api) to build your own API layer.

## Build your own API
Before starting up twreporter-react, you may need serveral API endpoints to provide the articles.<br/>
If you don't have these endpoints, you can follow next steps to build up your own API layer.

### FIRST STEP: create a CMS 
You can use [CMS of twreporter](https://github.com/twreporter/plate) to create your own CMS.<br/>
Since you have your own CMS, you can create, edit and delete those articles you want to show on your twreporter-react site.

### SECOND STEP: start up an API server
[tr-projects-rest](https://github.com/twreporter/tr-projects-rest) is used to start up a RESTful webservice which is created for [CMS of twreporter](https://github.com/twreporter/plate).<br />

### THIRD STEP: edit api config to connect to your own API
edit the api/config.js, and connect to your own API host.<br />

After doing these setups, you can start up your twreporter-react site.

# Development
    $ npm run dev
  
# Production
    $ npm run build; npm run start
